Hi there! I'd be happy to help you with your question about the HTML course in Sigma.

The content of HTML is covered in Video 1: "Installing VS Code & How Websites Work". To be more specific, it's introduced at around 1412 seconds into the video. The instructor mentions that they will learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript throughout this video.

As for how much content is taught, it seems to be a brief introduction to HTML, specifically mentioning the basics of an HTML document and its structure. If you'd like to learn more about HTML, I recommend checking out Video 1.

Let me know if there's anything else I can help with!
